## 3️⃣ Founder Message
Hi friend,

I’m Solomon O.—Chartered Accountant, son of a market trader, and the guy who has sat at kitchen tables with students, new immigrants, multicultural families, and small business owners who were tired of feeling behind. I built FinKnow because advice felt cold, shameful, and designed for someone else’s life. Money shouldn’t feel like that.

FinKnow is my promise: empathetic AI coaching, community-powered savings pods, and lessons stitched with cultural nuance. We’ll replace confusion with clarity, anxiety with agency, and guilt with gentle momentum. If you’ve ever felt unseen by traditional finance, you have a home here.

See you inside,

Solomon O. — Founder, FinKnow
